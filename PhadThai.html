        <h2 class="headertira1">Phad Thai</h2>
        <p class="partira">Pad Thai is a staple of Bangkok street food and sold in small, Thai villages.
        The dish's roots are Chinese. Its full name is kway teow phat Thai.
        Kway teow means rice noodles in a Chinese dialect, and the entire name means stir-fried rice noodles Thai-style.
        Noodles and stir-frying are very Chinese, and immigration likely brought the practice to Siam.
        Flavors like tamarind, palm sugar, and chilies were the Thai twists.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>

<li></li>

  <ul>
  <li>250g pack medium rice noodle</li>
  <li>2 tsp tamarind paste</li>
  <li>3 tbsp fish sauce</li>
  <li>2 tsp sugar</li>
  <li>1 garlic clove</li>
  <li>3 spring onions</li>
  <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
  <li>1 egg</li>
  <li>200g pack large cooked prawn</li>
  <li>75g beansprout</li>
  <li>handful salted peanut, chopped to serve</li>
  <li>Lime wedges</li>
</ul>

  <div class="Method">
<h2>Method</h2>
<ul>
<li>Soften the rice noodles: Tip the noodles into a large bowl and pour over a kettle of boiling water until they are covered. Leave to stand for 5-10 mins until the noodles are soft, then drain well. (You can do this part ahead of time – then just run the noodles under cold water until cool, and toss through a little oil to stop them from sticking.) Next, mix together the tamarind paste, fish sauce and sugar in a small bowl.>
<li>Stir-fry the vegetables: Peel and finely chop the garlic. Trim the ends off the spring onions and cut into thin slices about 1cm long. Heat a wok or large frying pan over a high heat. When it’s really hot (a drop of water should sizzle straight away), pour in the oil and swirl around. Tip in garlic and spring onions. To stir-fry, take a spatula or tongs and toss the veg around the wok so they’re moving all the time. Cook for 30 secs, just until they begin to soften.</li>
<li>Cook the egg: Push the vegetables to the sides of the wok, then crack the egg into the centre. Keep stirring the egg for 30 secs until it begins to set and resembles a broken-up omelette.</li>
<li>To finish: Add the prawns and beansprouts, followed by the noodles, then pour over the fish sauce mixture. Toss everything together and heat through. Spoon out onto plates. Serve with some chopped peanuts sprinkled over and wedges of lime.</li>

  <h2 class="headertira1">Tiramisù</h2>
  <p class="partira">Tiramisù is a popular coffee-flavoured Italian dessert made of ladyfingers dipped in coffee, layered with a whipped mixture of eggs, sugar, and mascarpone cheese, flavoured with cocoa. The origins of this recipe, whose name means "pick me up", "cheer me up" or "lift me up", are often disputed among Italian regions of Veneto, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Piedmont, and others.</p>
