<div class="Method">
<h2>Method</h2>
<p>Preaheat oven to 190*C (374*f) Fan</p>
<p> To make the marinade beat the olive oil, bouillon cubes, mustard, lemon zest, lemon juice, garlic and honey in a food processor or mortar and pestle,
  until all of the ingredients are completely combined. Pour the marinade-sauce into a large baking pan.
Chop the potatoes into pieces and add them to the baking pan.
Place the pork chops on a cutting board to prep them.
There is usually a thick layer of fat on the outer side of the central bone of the pork chops. A good tip to make sure they cook properly but also to give them a nice shape is to make slits along this part, vertically towards the central bone.
Position the pork chops upright on the cutting board and using a sharp knife make 1 cm slits along the fat until your reach the central bone. This will help the fat shrink and cook nicely.
Transfer to baking pan along with the oregano, thyme and pepper. Mix well and make sure the fat side is directly touching the pan all around the edges so that it can cook properly and become crunchy.
If you have enough time cover with aluminum foil, refrigerate and let them marinate for 12 hours.
When ready to cook, add the water, cover well with aluminum foil and roast for 1 hour.
Remove the aluminum foil; mix and roast again for another Â½ hour to 60 minutes, until most of the liquid has reduced to a nice lemony sauce and the pork chops are golden.
When ready serve the lemony pork chops and potatoes with a generous amount of sauce.
